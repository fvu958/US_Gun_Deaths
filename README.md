# US_Gun_Deaths
A basic analysis exploring gun deaths in the US using data from FiveThirtyEight

Quick Observations:
- Gun deaths affect men more than women
    - Minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics, are affected. Many white people are affected, but compared to the percentage of the population, the percentage is not as much as the percentage that affects minorities

    - Seasonality also seems to affect the number of deaths with more occurring in the summer months and returning to normal levels in the winter.
        - This is probably due to many children, teenagers, and others who are out of school, out of work, and others who having more free time. This in turn can lead younger people especially to get into trouble. Higher temperatures may also affect mood and emotion thus leading to more gun deaths. EXPLORE FURTHER
